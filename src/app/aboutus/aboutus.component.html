        <p>Morocco is currently the prominent country in the North African music entertainment business, leading the charts regularly in various streaming platforms including Spotify, Youtube and Deezer. During the last 5 years, Morocco has continuously been an example for other North African countries for its various genres, creativity and wide popularity, convincing world-wide organization such as the UNESCO to support this art in Morocco. Despite this flourishing scene and increasing activity, it is well-known in Morocco that the music industry is non-existent. Most of the popular Moroccan artists today are either independent or are signing with European labels, as there are no other options for them, making it very challenging to make a living out of what they excel at. Due to this lack of infrastructure, monetization and instability, many independent artists are looking to record and produce their own music in a sort of “safe space” and trustworthy environment, depending on their budget and schedule. This is precisely what this website will offer them. Marek.ma is an aggregator website which will allow users to post their own music studios, services, prices, schedules, and pictures from amateur home-studios to professional full service studios, inviting other users to book a session depending their location, budget and availability. Marek is also about building a community, where independent sound engineers will build a reputation depending on the reviews and number of visits per week. It is about engaging the Moroccan musicians to help each other and create opportunities that would not have happened otherwise.</p>
